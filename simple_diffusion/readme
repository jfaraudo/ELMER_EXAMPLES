This example correspond to the simplest 2D diffusion problem: a rectangular system with a fixed constant concentration on top (0.1kg/m3)
and zero concentration (adsorbing boundary) at the bottom.
The separation between the surfaces is 1 cm. Each boundary has 0.5 cm length and Elmer assumes that the (implicit) third dimension is 1 m,
so the volume of the system is 0.01 x 0.005 x 1 = 5e-5 m3
Initially the fluid is empty of solute.
The diffusion coefficient of the solute is 1e-9 m2/s

We observe (correctly) the formation of a concentration gradient but the fluxes calculated by ELmer do not correspond to theory.
Fluxes and mass calculated by ELMER are stored in the .dat file (see the .dat.names file for details of calculation of each column in .dat)

EXPECTED STEADY STATE ACCORDING TO THEORY

The steady state corresponds to a linear concentration profile, with a concentration of 0.1 Kg/m3 on top (y=0.5 cm), 
0.05 Kg/m3 in the middle of the system  (y=0.25 cm) and 0 Kg/m3 at the bottom (y=0) and the average concentration is 0.05 Kg/m3.

The total mass inside the system is simply 0.05 Kg/m3 x 5e-5 m3 = 25e-7 Kg = 2.5 e-6 Kg, as correctly predicted by Elmer (see .dat file)

The mass diffusive flow has to be constant and equal across both surfaces (and across the system) and can be calculated from Ficks' law as:

1e-9 m2/s x (0.1 Kg/m3 / 1e-2 m) x (5e-3 m x 1 m) = 5e-11 Kg/s 

BRIEF DICUSSION OF PROBLEMS:

1) Deviations in the diffusive flux
The value given by Elmer (see columns 3 and 4 of .dat file) is very similar to that predicted by Fick's law, 
but there is a small difference. The small deviation from Fick's law is different at each surface, so the fluxes at both surfaces 
are not strictly equal as it should be in the steady state, there is a difference indicating a problem in the mass balance.

2) Convective flux 0
There is no convection and velocity is fixed to 0 (NS equations are not solved and convection not considered)
ELMER gives in the .dat file a convective flux of 4 orders of magnitude larger than the diffusive flux
